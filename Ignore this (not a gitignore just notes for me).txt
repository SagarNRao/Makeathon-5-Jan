workflow (with Locofy)
I make the design in Figma, give Pushan all the divs so he can add code to it using getelement functions.

I use Figma to make the design then convert it to code using locofy, i tag all the buttons and he can hook them up to do what they're supposed to do and then i add the animations either afterwards or before that (using JS/Boomstrap/Lotties).
